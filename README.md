#  Wind_CostCurves

Scripts used to generate Cost-supply curves for onshore and offshore wind as published in the journal Nature Climate Change titled 'Climate change impacts on renewable energy supply'.

A large part is developed by Monique Hoogwijk, see: Hoogwijk MM. On the global and regional potential of renewable energy sources [PhD]. Universiteit Utrecht, Faculteit Scheikunde; 2004.

The main script is wind_cc.m. To run that model with the ISIMIP data it was made as a function called wind_cc_ISIMIP.m and activated using the script Run_Wind_ISIMIPs.m.
